# HOUSE-PREDICTION - Using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on specific features. The dataset contains information about various houses, and the goal is to predict the price of a house given its features like size, number of rooms, etc.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict house prices using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about different houses, and it learns the relationship between the features of a house and its price. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of new houses based on their features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- **Size (in square feet)**
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Number of bathrooms**
- **Number of floors**
- **Year built**

The target variable is the **price** of the house.

## Project Structure

- `house_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the simple linear regression model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
